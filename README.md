# SQL Project WEEK 1 - Danny's Dinner 

**Danny's Dinner** is a subscription-based restaurant dataset where we analyze customer purchases, membership behavior, and loyalty points. The goal of this project was to use **advanced SQL techniques** to extract insights from transactional and membership data, simulating real-world business analytics scenarios.

The dataset included three main tables:
- `sales`: records of customer purchases including `product_id`, `order_date`, and `customer_id`.
- `menu`: menu items with their `product_name` and `price`.
- `members`: customer membership data with `customer_id` and `join_date`.

## SQL Techniques Used
- **Aggregations and Grouping:** `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY` for total spend, total items, and visit counts.  
- **Window Functions:** `DENSE_RANK()` to rank purchases, find first/most purchased items per customer, and compute member transaction order.  
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE` statements to calculate points based on rules (e.g., sushi 2x points, first-week double points).  
- **Joins:** Inner and left joins across `sales`, `menu`, and `members` to combine transactional and membership data.  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** For clean, stepwise calculations and intermediate tables.  
- **Time-Based Calculations:** Date differences to identify purchases before or after membership, and within specific periods.  
---
## Insights and Highlights
- Identified **most popular items overall** and **per customer**, enabling targeted promotions.  
- Tracked **membership influence** on purchase behavior, showing what customers buy before and after joining.  
- Calculated **loyalty points accurately** with multiple rules, demonstrating the ability to implement complex business logic in SQL.  
- Built **actionable datasets** using window functions and CTEs, showcasing advanced SQL capabilities.

# SQL Project WEEK 2 - Pizza Runner
**Pizza Runner** is a delivery-focused dataset that tracks customer orders, pizza details, runner assignments, and delivery logistics. The goal of this project was to leverage **advanced SQL skills** to clean, transform, and analyze complex transactional and operational data, producing actionable insights for business optimization.

The dataset included multiple tables:
- `customer_orders`: records of pizzas ordered, including `pizza_id`, `order_time`, `exclusions`, `extras`, and `customer_id`.
- `runner_orders`: delivery information including `runner_id`, `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration`, and `cancellation`.

- `pizza_recipes`: mapping of pizzas to standard toppings.
- `ratings`: newly created table to capture customer ratings for runners.

---
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, I performed extensive **data cleaning and normalization**:
- Converted null and `'null'` string values to standard empty strings (`''`) in `exclusions` and `extras`.
- Standardized delivery metrics: removed `'km'` and `'mins'` text, converted `distance` and `duration` to numeric types.
- Ensured date-time consistency for `order_time` and `pickup_time`.
- Normalized pizza ingredient data into a separate table for easier aggregation (`pizza_recipes_normalized`) and expanded extras and exclusions using `UNNEST`.
- Created `ratings` table for customer feedback, enabling integration of qualitative metrics with operational data.

These steps ensured that all subsequent SQL queries would produce accurate, reliable, and analyzable results.

---
## SQL Techniques Used
- **Aggregations and Grouping:** `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `GROUP BY` to track order volumes, pizza types, and ingredient usage.
- **Window Functions:** `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking deliveries, ingredients, and customer order sequences.
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE` statements to calculate points, delivery costs, and categorize orders with exclusions/extras.
- **Joins and CTEs:** Combined multiple tables (`customer_orders`, `runner_orders`, `pizza_names`, `pizza_toppings`) to produce consolidated metrics.
- **String Functions:** `STRING_AGG()`, `REPLACE()`, and `UNNEST()` for ingredient-level transformations and creating human-readable pizza order descriptions.
- **Time-Based Calculations:** Calculated preparation and delivery times, average speeds, and order durations.
- **Financial Calculations:** Estimated total revenue, runner payout costs, and net earnings per delivery scenario.
---
